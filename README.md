# College Prediction Based on Rank

This project is a C language-based college prediction system designed to help students estimate potential college options based on their **entrance exam rank and category**. It provides possible institutions a candidate can target during counseling.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Language**: C
- **Semester**: 1st Year, 1st Semester
- **Input**: Student’s entrance **rank** and **category**
- **Output**: Predicted college(s) that match the criteria

## 🧠 Features
- Accepts valid rank and category as input
- Uses conditional logic and data structures (arrays/if-else)
- Displays possible college options based on cut-off data
- Simple CLI-based interaction for students

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. User enters their **rank** (e.g., 55000) and **category** (e.g., OBC).
2. The program compares these values with a predefined dataset (hardcoded cutoffs).
3. It outputs **one or more college names** that match the given inputs.
